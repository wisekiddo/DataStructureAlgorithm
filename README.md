## Algorithms
### Sorting
#### Merge Sort
Mergesort is another divide and conquer algorithm. It continuously divides an array into two halves, recurses on both the left subarray and right subarray stops until it left 1 element, and finally merges the two sorted halves.

This is my favorite sorting algorithm other that it is predictable and used for variety of situations, it haa statbility that you can rely on.

##### Stability: High
##### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(nlog(n))
- Worst Case: O(nlog(n))
- Average Case: O(nlog(n))
